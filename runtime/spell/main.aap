# Toplevel Aap recipe for Vim spell files
#
# Usage:
# aap        generate all the .spl files
# aap diff   create all the diff files

# "hu" is at the end, because it takes a very long time.
# "eu" takes even longer (4 hours on my system).

# The existing .spl files need to be generated when the spell file format
# changes.  Depending on the Vim executable does that, but results in doing it
# much too often.  Generate a dummy .spl file and let the .spl depend on it, so
# that they are outdated when it changes.

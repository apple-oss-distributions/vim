# Style Guide:
# o English spelling!
# o Colour, not color
# o -iour, not -ior
# o -ise, not -ize.
# o No contractions.
# o Cannot, not can not.
# o White space, not whitespace
# o Backward (no s) when used as an adjective.
# o Command line for noun, command-line for adjective
# o Improve consistency of messages ...
# o - capitalisation for first English word after Ennn:
# o - capitalisation of: NetBeans, JSON, Python, Lisp, Cscope
# o TBC ...
#
# As with all guides, they should be followed unless there is a reason why they
# should not be for a particular message.
